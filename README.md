# Hack

This is a hack from 2003 that was used to delete all data from someone's computer. It's in the form of a .exe file, but I managed to put it on a website to make a demonstration, but that's mostly what that hack looks like.

By pressing this button, I tried to induce the same situation as when someone starts that .exe and then is passed through a series of images and a mini-game with a bird that does nothing but get attention to manage to delete everything without a trace.
